When briefing CIOs and senior IT executives, we are often told that migrating IT workloads to the cloud ranks among their highest priorities. This is followed by questions such as: 

 

How do I start? 

How should I build a plan for cloud migration for my entire portfolio? 

How will my organization be affected by this change? 

How can I use cloud computing to become a true partner to the business? 

 

To be successful in migrating workloads to a private/public cloud or to modern end-state data centers, organizations need to build this capability by putting in place a Cloud Strategy and a Cloud Center of Excellence.   The first step is to identify why an organization wants to embrace cloud and answer the following questions to identify the business and user requirements: 

 

What is the purpose of moving the workloads to the cloud? 

What are the business outcomes the organization wants to achieve by leveraging cloud? 

 

Organizations that have been successful in adopting cloud have all started by: 

 

Defining their cloud strategy 

Establishing a Cloud Program Team (aka Cloud Center of Excellence, Cloud Center of Expertise, etc..) - see Program Management 

 

They also used the following to plan the migration of workloads to the cloud.

Catalog existing applications: having a good understanding of existing applications 

Defining criteria for moving to or starting applications in the cloud: assessing your applications for suitability in the cloud 

Core infrastructure components: having those in place prior to migration; these include identity, networking, and security 

Acquire cloud development skills: retraining your staff and building the skill set required to migrate the workloads and then operate them in the cloud 

Retool for adoption and change management: start early in communicating to the organization about the cloud, why the organization is moving to the cloud, and what is the impact to the organization 

Take a systematic and disciplined approach to security and compliance:  these are required whether you go to the cloud or not, but migrating a workload to the cloud doesn't mean it's gone; you are still responsible, as an organization for the security and compliance that surrounds that workload and its data. 

 

Establish strategic objectives and outcomes 

 

Every journey must have a sense of its destination, its route, and when it will arrive. A migration journey to the cloud is no different. It is time well spent to engage senior members of IT—and, indeed, business leaders from around the enterprise—to understand all aspects of the cloud and which of the many options and approaches to take. 

 

Business & IT leaders are brought together to identify strategic objectives and learn how modernization can help drive progress toward specific outcomes.

The Cloud Strategy will drive the foundational and operational requirements that need to be in place to enable the workloads and operate them in the cloud.  These components include: 

Foundation - identity and networking layers that will support connection to workloads in the cloud 

Operational - documenting how workloads will be supported operationally, building the team that will manage them 

Workloads - strategic and technical workload assessments, business case for moving them to the cloud, program of change and program management (governance) 

Business objectives are reviewed and mapped to the workloads that support them. In addition, the initiatives that are already in progress and the transformational activities are reviewed and analyzed against the current workload program of change (roadmap) to see how it supports those initiatives. 

Objectives and Outcomes 

 

An organization needs to determine what outcomes and value they will get from moving workloads to the cloud. Determining that will help to define which workloads will go to the cloud and how to prioritize them through a program of change or roadmap. Having defined the Cloud strategy and goals, an organization is ready to initiate the process of assessing those workloads for suitability and deployment to the cloud. 

 

Here we outline some sample objectives and how they relate to a cloud migration strategy.  The objectives are mapped to their best cloud destination (or cloud service model) alternatives. An organization should already have these documented in its Cloud Strategy before undertaking workload migration activities.

If we look at some of these: 

Achieve rapid time to cloud is often achieved with the use of a lift and shift into an IaaS environment (Rehost).  This will get you into the cloud quickly and out of a data center you may be looking to close. 

Enable business agility with continuous innovation implies the modernization of an application in a PaaS environment and not just a lift and shift 
 

 

The objectives are used as input into the assessment and will help to determine the best cloud service model for each workload or application. 

 

Best Practice: Strategic Objectives and Outcomes 

 

When defining strategic objectives and outcomes, answer the following questions: 

What are the business drivers  pushing the organization to the cloud? 

What capabilities matter to you most in the cloud? 

What are your desired business outcomes? 

 

We provide you with some sample questions and answers that can be used to extract the business and user requirements to formulate the cloud strategy.   

 

Business questions include, but would not be limited to: 

 

Why are you going to the Cloud? 
Accelerate Time to market? Want to penetrate new markets? Secure access from anywhere? Better align IT expenses with business activities? 

What specific outcomes do you want to achieve by adopting Cloud? 
Reduce IT costs, reduce risk, drive business growth, enable IT scalability 

What do these potential benefits mean for the department or the business? 
Increased productivity, ability to focus on core competencies, better citizen experiences, agility, innovation 

How ready is your department to move to the cloud? 
Need to train staff in new skills, address fear of job loss, adjust ITIL operational support processes 

What are the compliance considerations? 
PCI, HIPAA, Protected B, etc. 

 

Building a training plan is often overlooked and should be addressed before you start migrating. 

 

User requirements might include: 

Type of User experience 
Seamless sign-on 

Connectivity/mobility 
Remote capability, type of access 

Locations 
Distributed, centralized 

Devices 
Android, iOS, laptops, tablets, etc. 

Access 
Public vs private domains 

Privacy 
Data sharing and rights management 

Performance expectations 
Based on the type of application - e.g. CAD 

 

Strategic objectives: 

 

Are high level and overarching 

Have clear traceability to and support the organizational strategy

Proven Practices 

 

Define strategic objectives that will be used as input into the workload assessment model 

Creation of a Cloud Center of Excellence, a team, to establish a practice for continuously evaluating and experimenting to determine the appropriate platform and destination for each application - see Program Management section 

Development of a Cloud Strategy Document with goals, timeframe, recommended strategy and expected benefits and outcomes prior to undertaking workload migration 

Engage other IT groups and selected Lines of Business to build the Cloud Strategy including, but not limited to: Enterprise Architecture, Information Security and Risk Management, Data Classification, Finance, Operations, Human Resources, Application Teams, and impacted Lines of Business 

 

Once the cloud strategy has been defined, we extract the Strategic Objectives and leverage them for the assessment of workloads we are considering for migration to the cloud.  This is covered in the next section.
